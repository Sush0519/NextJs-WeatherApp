Welcome to the Next.js WeatherApp! This project demonstrates a weather  web application built with Next.js and integrated with the Zomato Weather API. The application allows users to search for weather information by entering a locality name, providing a smooth and interactive experience.


𝐅𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞𝐬 ⚙️

𝐒𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐜𝐡 𝐅𝐮𝐧𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲: Enter a locality name in the search bar on the Google homepage to find weather information.

𝐖𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫 𝐃𝐢𝐬𝐩𝐥𝐚𝐲 𝐏𝐚𝐠𝐞: After entering a locality, you will be redirected to a page that displays current weather details for the entered location.

𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐙𝐨𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐨 𝐀𝐏𝐈: Utilizes the Zomato API to fetch and display weather data based on the locality name provided.


𝐔𝐬𝐚𝐠𝐞 📃

𝐀𝐜𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐇𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐩𝐚𝐠𝐞: Upon opening the application, you'll see the Google homepage with a search bar.

𝐒𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐜𝐡 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐋𝐨𝐜𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲: Enter a locality name in the search bar and hit Enter. This will redirect you to the Weather Display Page.

𝐓𝐞𝐜𝐡𝐧𝐨𝐥𝐨𝐠𝐢𝐞𝐬 𝐔𝐬𝐞𝐝 🔧

𝐍𝐞𝐱𝐭.𝐣𝐬: Used as the core framework for building both the server-side rendered and statically generated parts of the application. It handles routing, server-side rendering, and API interactions, enabling efficient and scalable page rendering.

𝐓𝐚𝐢𝐥𝐰𝐢𝐧𝐝 𝐂𝐒𝐒: Employed for styling the application. Tailwind CSS’s utility-first approach allows for rapid and consistent design implementation, providing a clean and responsive layout across the app without custom CSS.

𝐓𝐲𝐩𝐞𝐒𝐜𝐫𝐢𝐩𝐭: Utilized to add static types to the application’s codebase. TypeScript enhances the development experience by providing type safety and reducing runtime errors, leading to more reliable and maintainable code.
